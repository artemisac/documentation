# Obtaining the loader

## Introduction

Getting the loader is the first step in all of this. Considering you've purchased Artemis and have received your license
key, it would be most obvious you'd have a https://panel.artemis.ac/login account. If not, set one up, confirm it by 
email and contact us to redeem your license.

## Tutorial

Assuming you've now got your license and so and forth, lets proceed in obtaining the loader. Log-into your account and 
go to the following page:

Make sure to save the file locally. You'll need it to install it on every instance you have. Without it, Artemis will 
not boot.

Now, you want to note down your license. Your license is soft maxed at 5 sessions. If you wish to use it on more sessions,
have an enterprise plan and can justify its origin, you are free to contact us for a free* expansion.
